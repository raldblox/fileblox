# FileBlox

FileBlox is a trailblazing platform that revolutionizes content creation by harnessing the power of Web3 technologies. It is a decentralized marketplace for copyrighted content, providing a secure and fair ecosystem for creators to sell their digital assets as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).

## Problem Statement

In the era of Web2, content creators faced numerous challenges. Their hard work often fell victim to unauthorized reproduction and distribution, leaving creators frustrated and uncompensated. The lack of proper attribution and control over their own work left a void in the content creation landscape.

## Solution

FileBlox addresses the core issues faced by content creators through its innovative approach:

1. **Decentralized Marketplace:** FileBlox leverages decentralized protocols to create a marketplace where creators can sell their copyrighted files directly to buyers, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation.

2. **File Encryption and NFTs:** FileBlox utilizes file encryption techniques to protect content until a user purchases it as an NFT. This enables creators to securely gate their digital assets and prevent unauthorized use.

## Key Features

- Securely gate content until purchased as an NFT.
- Empower artists, photographers, and creators to sell their copyrighted files.
- Provide protection against unauthorized use and promote a fair creator economy.

## How it Works

FileBlox follows a simple process to enable creators to monetize their content:

1. **Store to IPFS:** Files are securely stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized and distributed file system, ensuring data redundancy and availability.

2. **Encrypt Hash:** The files are encrypted and assigned a unique hash that serves as proof of ownership.

3. **Record on Chain:** The encrypted hash and ownership details are recorded on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

4. **Ready to Tokenize:** Once the content is prepared, it can be tokenized as an NFT, allowing creators to sell their digital assets on the FileBlox marketplace.
